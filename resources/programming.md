# Programming & Cybersecurity Resources For Beginners 

**First things first, here's what you'll need to get into coding or cybersecurity** :

1. **Devices :** A laptop/PC (recommended), a stable internet connection. If you don't have a laptop or PC and you still want to learn how to code you can use stuff like Termux on Android and you are good to go (Fun Fact : [Nallabot](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTeenagers/comments/16gtq4r/nallabot_just_got_a_huge_upgrade/)'s production is totally hosted on an android device with Termux and actively developed through Neovim on android, shoutout to it's developer /u/DeadShoT_035). If you want to do coding on an android device feel free to follow [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/can-you-code-on-a-phone/).
2. **OS :** You can use Linux, Windows or MacOS (any OS you want). Although, if you want to develop iOS apps with XCode you'll need to use MacOS & if you want to do anything other than that you are good to go with Linux & Windows. I personally currently use Arch Linux (KDE Plasma) and Manjaro (XFCE). For cybersecurity and pentesting if you use Windows, it's highly recommended you use [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) or a Virtual Machine with a distro like Kali as some required tools for cybersecurity & pentesting don't work properly on windows directly.
3. **IDE :** IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development. An IDE typically includes a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger, all integrated into a single user interface. You can use any good IDE like Neovim, Visual Studio Code or Jetbrains. Although I recommend [Visual Studio Code.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started in Programming

### Web Development  

Web development involves creating websites or web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure, CSS styles the layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity. Beginners can start by learning these foundational languages and gradually explore frameworks and libraries to enhance their skills. Here are some resources to get started in Web Development. You can also learn about frameworks like React & React.js.

# Machine Learning & AI Resources

Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are like teaching computers to learn and make decisions on their own. Imagine you have a smart friend who learns from examples â€“ ML is like that! AI is the bigger picture where computers become clever enough to think and solve problems, almost like a brain. People use data to train computers, just like how you learn from experiences. So, ML and AI help computers become super-smart problem solvers!  Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming. AI development involves creating algorithms that enable machines to mimic human intelligence, while ML focuses on training these algorithms using real-world data. Here are some resources :
