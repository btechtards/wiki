# DSA & Leetcode Resources 

Here is the compilation of some DSA & Leetcode resources we could find. 

There's a [community guide](https://wiki.developersindia.in/faqs/how-to-start-dsa.html) on r/developersIndia about DSA & Leetcode. Also someone shared a lot of information about leetcode & competitive programming [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/xi7b4d/cp_resources_faqs_etc_for_beginners/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
